codepad.el --- Emacs integration for codepad.org

See http://codepad.org

Codepad is a pastebin where you can paste code and share it on a chat or via email. Codepad also provides an online compiler/interpreter and can run your programs online.

emacs-codepad provides an Emacs integration for Codepad. Currently you can use it to paste your code to and fetch code from Codepad.

codepad.el is based on gist.el ( http://github.com/defunkt/gist.el/blob/master/gist.el ) which was written by Christian Neukirchen and others. codepad.el is written by RÃ¼diger Sonderfeld. You can contact me via E-Mail: ruediger@c-plusplus.de.

Thanks to Thomas Weidner <thomas001le@gmail.com> for his patches and help. Thanks to Lorenzo Villani <lvillani@binaryhelix.net> for fixing the "error in process filter: Symbol's value as variable is void: url-max-redirections" issue.

== Installation ==
I'm using Emacs 23.1. codepad.el has problems with older versions of Emacs (url.el)! If codepad.el won't work please upgrade your Emacs.

Installation is straight forward:

Add the following lines to your ~/.emacs

  (add-to-list 'load-path "PATH") ;; replace PATH with the path to codepad.el
  (autoload 'codepad-paste-region "codepad" "Paste region to codepad.org." t)
  (autoload 'codepad-paste-buffer "codepad" "Paste buffer to codepad.org." t)
  (autoload 'codepad-fetch-code "codepad" "Fetch code from codepad.org." t)

Restart Emacs (or evaluate those lines) and you can use codepad.el by calling M-x codepad-paste-region to paste the current selected region or M-x codepad-paste-buffer to paste the current selected buffer.

You can configure codepad.el by calling M-x customize-group codepad

Good news Gentoo users: codepad.el is currently part of Gentoo's Emacs Overlays ( http://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/emacs/browser/emacs-overlay/app-emacs/codepad ) and it will move to the official tree in the near future.
